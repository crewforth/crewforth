#   1) Golden routing  — each example prompt must contain (as a substring) one trigger of its expected target.
#   2) Agent collision  — two DIFFERENT agents must not share the same trigger phrase (routing ambiguity).
# Turkish diacritics are normalized on both sides (guvenlik == güvenlik), so it is also robust for
# users who type without diacritics. In a pruned install, a line whose target is not installed is SKIPPED.

# build fails on CI" to the frontend expert, because `build` contains `ui` and `UI` is one of its triggers.
# Every short trigger has that failure mode (ui · api · e2e), and it points the wrong way — a CI failure sent to
# the frontend agent is worse than no routing at all, because it looks like Crewforth worked.

# prompts routed to the wrong owner while section 1 reported both green. "the app feels laggy after the last
# release" went to `release`; "is this endpoint fast enough on the hot path" went to the backend agent.
#
# So this section feeds every golden case through the REAL hook — not a second matcher, which would be the same
# rule written twice and free to drift from the one that actually routes. It counts a positive as a hit when the
# hook names the expected target, or names the agent whose body applies that expected skill: by design the hook
# prefers an agent over a skill, and the agent carries the skill with it (the same notion §3b uses to call a
# skill routed). A negative (`!target`) must never be what the hook names.

# be allowed to win is an open decision recorded in the roadmap, and this is the measurement that decision waits on.
